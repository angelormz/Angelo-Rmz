# Hi there :v:

## I´m a Software Developer :computer:

I´m currently learning Javascript and Python. 

My past experiences includes digital marketing, business management and sales B2B.

I :green_heart: web and mobile development.

I´m looking :eyes: to collaborate on an open source project, in a startup or a freelance project that includes technologies that I´m currently working on.

I love to teach what I´ve learned in this path. Something you can ask me is about HTML, CSS, JS and Python.
